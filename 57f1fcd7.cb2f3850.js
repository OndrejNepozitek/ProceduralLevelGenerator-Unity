This process repeats every time the texture is too small. The problem is that as the texture gets larger, more CPU time is needed to create the texture and upload it to the GPU. I did a simple benchmark and it looks like the performance is good enough for levels with up to 250k tiles (i.e. the bounding box of the level is approx. 500x500 tiles).
